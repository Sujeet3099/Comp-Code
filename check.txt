Always see tha value is initialised or not,  as its garbage may spoil your code output;
Aways check your if and else if is covering every scenario;
always check that all the value declared for taking input are getting input and at the right place and time;
Check for the type conversions....make sure ll is assigned to ll and no int;
Check whether tsking floor or ceil value after dividing with float number
Before submitting always check the format of the output and the number of test case issue

//power code study
ll power(ll x,ll y,ll p){
	ll res=1; 
	x=x%p;
	if(x==0) return 0;
	while(y>0){
		if(y&1) res=(res*x)%p;
		y=y>>1;
		x=(x*x)%p;
	}
	return res;
}
